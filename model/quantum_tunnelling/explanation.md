This code simulates quantum tunneling, a fundamental quantum mechanics phenomenon, and converts the deterministic result of this simulation into a "hash" value. The process is based on modeling a particle "leaking" through an energy barrier.

1. Step: Defining the Initial Conditions (From Seed to Physics)
Everything begins with a 64-byte (512-bit) seed provided by seed_bytes or seed_int. This seed is used to deterministically set all the physical parameters of the simulation. In short, the seed defines the initial conditions of the "universe" to be simulated.

The params_from_seed() method: It takes this seed and converts it into the following physical quantities:

x 
0
​
 : The initial center position of the wave packet.

k 
0
​
 : The initial average momentum of the wave packet. This determines how fast and in what direction the particle is moving. The relationship between momentum (p) and wave number (k) is p=ℏk.

σ: The width of the wave packet. This represents the uncertainty in the particle's position according to the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle.

V 
0
​
 : The height of the potential barrier. It indicates how much higher the barrier is than the particle's energy.

barrier_width: The width of the potential barrier.

barrier_center: The position of the potential barrier.

dt: The size of the time step in the simulation.

2. Step: Describing the Particle (Gaussian Wave Packet)
A particle does not exist at a single point like a classical billiard ball. In quantum mechanics, its position and momentum are described by a wave function, Ψ(x,t). The code models the particle at the initial time (t=0) as a Gaussian wave packet.

The create_wave_packet() method: This creates the initial wave function, Ψ(x,0), with the following formula:

Ψ(x,0)=A⋅e

2σ

(x−x

​

Meaning of the Formula:

e 
− 
2σ

(x−x

​
 ) 
2
 
​
 
 : This is the Gaussian envelope of the wave packet. It confines the magnitude of the function around x=x 
0
​
 , indicating that the particle is initially "localized" around x 
0
​
 . σ is the width of this envelope.

e 
ik 
0
​
 x
 : This is the plane wave term. It gives the particle an initial momentum related to k 
0
​
  and makes it travel in the positive x direction.

A: This is a normalization constant. It ensures that the probability of finding the particle somewhere in all of space is 1 (∫ 
−∞
∞
​
 ∣Ψ(x,0)∣ 
2
 dx=1).

3. Step: Defining the Barrier (Potential Barrier)
The obstacle the particle will face is defined as a simple rectangular potential barrier.

The define_barrier_center_width() method: This creates the potential energy function V(x):

V(x)={ 
V 
0
​
 
0
​
  
if a≤x≤b
otherwise
​
 
Here, a and b are the start and end points of the barrier. In classical physics, if the particle's energy is E<V 
0
​
 , it would never be able to cross this barrier. However, in quantum mechanics, a part of the wave function can "leak" into the barrier and pass to the other side. This phenomenon is called tunneling.

4. Step: Running the Simulation (Time Evolution)
This is the core of the simulation. How the wave packet changes over time is governed by one of the most fundamental equations of physics, the Time-Dependent Schrödinger Equation (TDSE).

The evolve_tdse() method: This equation calculates the evolution of the wave function over time:

iℏ 
∂t
∂Ψ(x,t)
​
 = 
H
^
 Ψ(x,t)=[− 
2m
ℏ

​
  
∂x

∂ 
2
 
​
 +V(x)]Ψ(x,t)
Meaning of the Equation:

H
^
 : The Hamiltonian operator, which represents the total energy of the system (kinetic + potential).

− 
2m
ℏ 
2
 
​
  
∂x 
2
 
∂ 
2
 
​
 : The kinetic energy operator ( 
T
^
 ).

V(x): The potential energy operator ( 
V
^
 ).

Solving this equation analytically is difficult, so the code uses a powerful numerical technique called the Split-Step Fourier Method.

Split-Step Fourier Method:

The wave function is transformed from position space to momentum space using a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT).

In momentum space, the effect of the kinetic energy operator is easily applied (it's a simple multiplication).

The wave function is transformed back to position space using an Inverse Fast Fourier Transform (IFFT).

In position space, the effect of the potential energy operator is applied (again, a simple multiplication).

These steps are repeated hundreds of times for small time intervals (dt), simulating the interaction of the wave packet with the barrier, where some of it is reflected and some of it tunnels through.

Absorbing Boundary Conditions: To prevent the wave packet from reflecting off the edges of the simulation area and creating false interference patterns, an artificial "damping" region is created at the boundaries to "absorb" the wave function.

5. Step: Measuring the Result and Converting it to a Hash
When the simulation is complete (after N 
t
​
  steps), we have the final wave function Ψ(x,t 
final
​
 ). According to the Born rule of quantum mechanics, the probability of finding the particle at position x is given by the probability density:

Probability Density:
P(x)=∣Ψ(x,t 
final
​
 )∣ 
2
 =Ψ 
∗
 (x,t 
final
​
 )⋅Ψ(x,t 
final
​
 )

The get_hash() method:

First, this probability density (prob_density) is calculated. This is an array of positive real numbers representing the probability of finding the particle at each point in space.

This array of numbers carries a complex fingerprint of the particle's tunneling, reflection, and scattering history.

The code then takes the raw bit patterns of these float64 values and interprets them as uint64 integers.

These integers are combined with words derived from the initial seed and repeatedly mixed using a non-cryptographic but chaotic and well-mixing function like splitmix64.

This mixing process ensures that even a small change in the probability distribution leads to a large change in the final hash value (avalanche effect).

Finally, the resulting bit string is truncated to the desired length (output_bits) to produce the final hash value.

Summary
In short, the process is as follows:

Seed → Physical Initial Conditions → Quantum Particle (Wave Packet) → Evolution via the Schrödinger Equation → Tunneling Event → Final Probability Distribution → Digital Fingerprint (Hash).

This method uses the complexity and unpredictability (akin to deterministic chaos) of a fundamental law of nature to generate a hash, rather than standard algorithms like SHA-256.
