This code simulates a fundamental quantum mechanics phenomenon called **quantum tunneling** and deterministically converts the result of this simulation into a "hash" value. The process is based on modeling how a particle "leaks" through an energy barrier.

### Step 1: Determining Initial Conditions (From Seed to Physics)

Everything begins with a 64-byte (512-bit) **seed** provided via `seed_bytes` or `seed_int`. This seed is used to deterministically set all the physical parameters of the simulation. In short, the seed defines the initial conditions of the "universe" to be simulated.

The `params_from_seed()` method: Takes this seed and converts it into the following physical quantities:
*   **$x_0$**: The initial center position of the wave packet.
*   **$k_0$**: The initial average momentum of the wave packet. This determines how fast the particle is moving and in which direction. The relationship between momentum ($p$) and wavenumber ($k$) is $p=\hbar k$.
*   **$\sigma$**: The width of the wave packet. This represents the uncertainty in the particle's position, in accordance with the **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle**.
*   **$V_0$**: The height of the potential barrier. It indicates how much higher it is than the particle's energy.
*   **barrier_width**: The width of the potential barrier.
*   **barrier_center**: The position of the potential barrier.
*   **dt**: The size of the time step in the simulation.

### Step 2: Defining the Particle (Gaussian Wave Packet)

A particle is not located at a single point like a classical billiard ball. In quantum mechanics, its position and momentum are described by a **wave function, $\Psi(x,t)$**. The code models the particle at the initial time ($t=0$) as a **Gaussian wave packet**.

The `create_wave_packet()` method: Creates this initial wave function, $\Psi(x,0)$, using the following formula:

$$\Psi(x,0)=A \cdot e^{-\frac{(x-x_0)^2}{2\sigma^2}} \cdot e^{ik_0x}$$

**Meaning of the Formula:**
*   $e^{-\frac{(x-x_0)^2}{2\sigma^2}}$: This is the **Gaussian envelope** of the wave packet. It confines the amplitude of the function around $x=x_0$, indicating the particle is initially "localized" near $x_0$. $\sigma$ is the width of this envelope.
*   $e^{ik_0x}$: This is the **plane wave term**. It gives the particle an initial momentum associated with $k_0$, moving it in the positive $x$ direction.
*   $A$: This is a **normalization constant**. It ensures the total probability of finding the particle anywhere in space is 1 ($\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}|\Psi(x,0)|^2 dx=1$).

### Step 3: Defining the Obstacle (Potential Barrier)

The obstacle the particle encounters is defined as a simple **rectangular potential barrier**.

The `define_barrier_center_width()` method: Creates the potential energy function $V(x)$:

$$V(x) = \begin{cases} V_0 & \text{if } a \le x \le b \\ 0 & \text{otherwise} \end{cases}$$

Here, $a$ and $b$ are the start and end points of the barrier. In classical physics, if the particle's energy $E < V_0$, it could never cross this barrier. However, in quantum mechanics, part of the wave function can "tunnel" into and through the barrier to the other side. This event is called **tunneling**.

### Step 4: Running the Simulation (Time Evolution)

This is the heart of the simulation. How the wave packet changes over time is governed by one of the most fundamental equations in physics: the **Time-Dependent Schrödinger Equation (TDSE)**.

The `evolve_tdse()` method: Calculates the time evolution of the wave function using this equation:

$$i\hbar\frac{\partial\Psi(x,t)}{\partial t} = \hat{H}\Psi(x,t) = \left[-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2} + V(x)\right]\Psi(x,t)$$

**Meaning of the Equation:**
*   $\hat{H}$: The **Hamiltonian operator**, representing the total energy of the system (kinetic + potential).
*   $-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2}$: The **kinetic energy operator** ($\hat{T}$).
*   $V(x)$: The **potential energy operator** ($\hat{V}$).

Solving this equation analytically is difficult, so the code uses a powerful numerical technique called the **Split-Step Fourier Method**.

**Split-Step Fourier Method:**
1.  The wave function is transferred from position space to momentum space using the **Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)**.
2.  In momentum space, the effect of the kinetic energy operator is easily applied (it's a simple multiplication).
3.  The wave function is brought back to position space using the **Inverse Fast Fourier Transform (IFFT)**.
4.  In position space, the effect of the potential energy operator is applied (again, a simple multiplication).

These steps are repeated hundreds of times for small $dt$ time intervals, simulating the wave packet's interaction with the barrier, partial reflection, and partial tunneling.

**Absorbing Boundary Conditions (`absorbing_boundary`):** To prevent the wave packet from reaching the edges of the simulation area, reflecting back, and creating artificial interference patterns, an artificial damping region is created at the edges to "absorb" the wave function.

### Step 5: Measuring the Result and Converting to Hash

When the simulation is finished (after $N_t$ steps), we have the final wave function $\Psi(x,t_{final})$. According to the **Born rule** of quantum mechanics, the probability of finding the particle at position $x$ is given by the probability density:

**Probability Density:**
$P(x)=|\Psi(x,t_{final})|^2 = \Psi^*(x,t_{final}) \cdot \Psi(x,t_{final})$

The `get_hash()` method:
*   First, this probability density (`prob_density`) is calculated. This is an array of positive real numbers indicating the likelihood of finding the particle at each point in space.
*   This array of numbers carries a complex fingerprint of the particle's history of tunneling, reflection, and scattering.
*   The code then takes the raw bit patterns of these `float64` values in the array and interprets them as `uint64` integers.
*   These integers are combined with words derived from the initial seed and repeatedly scrambled using a non-cryptographic but chaotic and well-mixing function like **splitmix64**.
*   This mixing process ensures that even a tiny change in the probability distribution results in a significant change in the final hash value (**avalanche effect**).
*   Finally, the resulting bit string is truncated to the desired length (`output_bits`) to produce the final hash value.

### Summary

In short, the process is:

**Seed → Physical Initial Conditions → Quantum Particle (Wave Packet) → Evolution via Schrödinger Equation → Tunneling Event → Final Probability Distribution → Numerical Fingerprint (Hash)**.

In this case, quantum tunneling was applied only once throughout the entire algorithm, and approximately 97% success was achieved in the NIST tests. With the repeated application of the tunneling model multiple times in succession, an increase in success is inevitable.
