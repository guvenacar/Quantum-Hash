# Quantum-Hash
**Quantum-Resistant Hash Project**

This project was initiated with the aim of developing new hash algorithms resistant to quantum computing by modeling phenomena from the atomic world of physics. The ultimate goal is to design secure cryptographic structures resistant to both classical and post-quantum computational attacks.

## Current Status
The project is currently in its initial phase, focusing on the generation of seed values. Unlike traditional hash algorithms that use fixed initial values, this project employs the concept of dynamic seed values.

## Features
- High entropy and unpredictability with dynamic initial values  
- Increased resistance against analytical attacks  
- Potential adaptability with quantum-inspired models  

## Future Plans
- Investigation of the evolution and adaptation processes of dynamic seeds  
- Interaction with quantum-inspired randomness models  
- Development of new approaches for post-quantum cryptography
