# Quantum-Hash

**Quantum Resistance Hash Project**

This project has been initiated with the aim of modeling the subatomic world of physics to develop new hash algorithms that demonstrate quantum resistance. The ultimate goal is to design secure cryptographic primitives capable of withstanding both classical and post-quantum computational attacks.

At the current stage, the project is in its initial phase, focusing on the generation of the main seed values. Unlike traditional hash algorithms, which rely on fixed initial values, this project introduces the concept of dynamic initial seeds.

By employing dynamic starting values, the design seeks to achieve a higher degree of unpredictability and entropy, making the resulting hashes more resistant to analytical attacks and increasing overall cryptographic strength.

Future iterations of this project will explore how these dynamically generated seeds can evolve, adapt, and interact with quantum-inspired models of randomness, potentially leading to novel approaches in post-quantum cryptography.
